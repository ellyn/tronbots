# tronbots
TRONBOTS is an implementation of the two-player variant of the classic arcade game TRON, built with Python 2.7 with pygame 1.9.1. It also includes bots that use different AI gameplay strategies, such as minimax with alpha-beta pruning and local search with various heuristic functions. 

TRONBOTS is designed with a minimal and modern-looking interface. All fonts and images used are original creations or were freely distributed.

In this game, you can play against a bot or have two bots play against each other. A human player can control the character with either the arrow keys or the WASD keyboard buttons.
